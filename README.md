# Incognito Proxy 

Incognito mode is nice, but your ISP sees the traffic.  VPNs are pretty neat, but you'll solve CAPTCHAs all day.  Why not pick the best of both, with an incognito-only VPN?

The requirements are a SOCKS5 proxy server and a secure tunnel, such as WireGuard with `allowed-ips w.x.y.z/32` (IP address of the proxy) or `ssh -D1080`.  There are commercial VPN providers with WireGuard and SOCKS5, or you could self-host. The **Incognito&nbsp;Proxy** extension solves the sub-problem of "How do I configure a SOCKS5 proxy specifically for Incognito tabs?"

More generally, **this extension configures proxy settings**. It has few features, but its namesake feature is the ability to configure *different* proxy/direct settings for regular windows and incognito windows.

I've tested the "Incognito to SOCKS5 over WireGuard" config on a Chromebook; it is unobtrusive, survives rebooting, and I can still LAN print. Annoyingly, Chrome's WireGuard config forced me to pick a static DNS server; `0.0.0.0` worked at first, but not reliably.

The 'disable_non_proxied_udp' option can prevent WebRTC from leaking your non-proxied IP address.

## Note to other proxy extension developers

Please steal my code, because 'incognito proxy' is a good feature. I copied it from [chrome-extensions-samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/475b4b6bf1a376e0cb0de715652a46a458b5fe72/mv2-archive/extensions/proxy_configuration) and made minor improvements.
